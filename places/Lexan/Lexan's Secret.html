<h1>Lexan</h1>
</li>
<li>The secret of Lexan is that at the top of the mountain, lives a wise old Adult Brass Dragon called [[Marvelon]]. Only [[Lexan Arcaneum Staff|professors]] at the [[Lexan Arcaneum|arcaneum]] know of his existence, and how to get up to his cave.</li>
<li>Revealing his secret to outsiders without good reason is a fireable offence</li>
<li>[[Mettle]] does not know about [[Marvelon]]</li>
